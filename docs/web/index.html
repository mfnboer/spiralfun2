<h2>How to create a spiral</h2>

<p>
The dynamics by which a spiral are created are simple: a circle orbiting around a circle orbiting around a circle...
</p>
<p>
Think of Earth orbiting around the sun.
The central circle (the sun) is always stationary. So with two circles things become boring very quickly as
the only shape that you get is a circle. You can change the diameter of the circles which will change the size
of the shape, but it will still be a circle. You can change the rotation direction or the number of the rotations
of the second circle, but again it will still draw a circle.
</p>
<img src="two_circles_1.gif" class="round" alt="" style="max-width: 30%; max-height: 220px; object-fit: contain;">
<img src="two_circles_2.gif" class="round" alt="" style="max-width: 30%; max-height: 220px; object-fit: contain;">
<img src="two_circles_3.gif" class="round" alt="" style="max-width: 30%; max-height: 220px; object-fit: contain;">
<p>
With three circles it begins to get interesting. When you start the Spiral Fun app, it shows three
circles. When you play this configuration, you will see this. To play the configuration press the
play button.
</p>
<img src="three_circles_1.gif" class="round" width="220" height="212" alt="">
<p>
To see or change the settings for each circle you can use the arrow buttons to navigate up and down
the circle. The active circle will show a thick edge. The settings below are the settings for the
active circle. There you can see and change the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Diameter</li>
<li>The number of rotations</li>
<li>The rotation direction (clockwise / anti-clockwise)</li>
<li>Color</li>
<li>The thickness of the line to draw, or not draw a line at all.</li>
</ul>
<p>
To change the number of circles, you change the number in the "Circles:" box. To select a circle
you can also tap the circle on the screen instead of using the arrows to navigate. This works fine
for large circles, but very small circles may be hard to tap.
</p>
<p>
Let's make a small change. Navigate to the second circle (the middle one). The number of rotations
is set at 5 at startup. Change it to 6. If you just played the previous configuration and you do not
see the circles, but the drawn shape, then first press the "home" button to reset the scene.
</p>
<p>
When you play the changed configuration you will get this:
</p>
<img src="three_circles_2.gif" class="round" width="206" height="230" alt="">
<p>
This is all there is to it! At first it may seem that the spirals you can create will be very limited
in shape, but that is not true. Here is an example with seven circles:
</p>
<img src="seven_circles_1.gif" class="round" alt="" style="max-width: 100%; object-fit: contain;">
<p>
You may think that you need many circles to create interesting spirals, but that is not true either.
Here is an interesting spiral that was create with only three circles:
</p>

<p>
You can find more creations in the "Examples" menu.
<div class="app">
Or take al look on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/spiralfun/">
Instagram</a>
</div>
</p>
After playing a configuration, several items in the menu get enabled for saving and sharing.

<h2>Save image</h2>

When you click "Save image" the image will be save as JPG in your gallery in an album called
"Spiral Fun". All your Spiral Fun images will be save into this album.

<h2>Share picture</h2>

After playing a configuration, the share button appears in the lower right corner. With
this you can share your creation on social media, WhatsApp, mail, etc. With the image
a URL will be shared. Clicking this link will open the Spiral Fun app with the configuration
that created the picture. If someone does not have the Spiral Fun app, then clicking the
link will bring you to Spiral Fun in Google Play.

<h2>Save configuration</h2>

With this option you will save your configuration, i.e. the number of circles and all the
settings of the individual circles, such that you can play it again at a later time.

<h2>Record GIF</h2>

This option will restart the playing, but this time a GIF will be created. Note that playing will be slower
due to the GIF creation process. When the playing is finished, you can find the GIF in the "Spiral
Fun" album.
<p>
Note that a GIF file can become large, i.e. more than 100MB. This depends on the complexity of
your spiral image.
</p>

<h2>Share GIF</h2>

After recording a GIF, the share button appears in the lower right corner. With this you can
share the GIF. If the GIF is large then it may be refused by some applications.

<h2>Load configuration</h2>

With this menu option you can load a previously saved configuration. You can delete a saved configuration
by pressing and holding it for a few seconds.

<div id="play_mutation_sequence">
<h2>Play mutation sequence</h2>
</div>

With a mutation sequence you can create morph-like animations. You create a sequence of spiral images.
Each image is created by changing one setting of one circle in the configuration. The following changes
are possible:

<ul>
<li>Increase rotations by 1</li>
<li>Decrease rotations by 1</li>
<li>Increase diameter by 1</li>
<li>Decrease diameter by 1</li>
<li>Flip rotation direction</li>
</ul> 

<p>
You define 1 or more mutations and set the length of the sequence, i.e. the number of images to
create. For each mutation you set the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Circle</li>
<li>What trait to mutate, i.e. rotations, diameter or direction.</li>
<li>The change to make</li>
</ul>
<p>
The circles are numbered starting at the center circle as 1. The next circle is 2, and so on.
</p>
<img src="circle_numbers.jpg" class="round" width="157" height="227" alt="">
<p>
Every next image is created by applying the next mutation from your list. If the list of mutations
is exhausted then the first mutation is picked again.
</p>
<p>
If decrease of rotations result in 0 rotations for a circle then the next decrement will flip
the rotation direction and the number of rotations will increase in the flipped direction.
If decrease of a diameter result in a diameter of 1, then the diameter will not be decreased
any further.
</p>
<p>
If you enable "Add reverse sequence" then the total sequence becomes twice as large. After the first
sequence has been played, the mutations are applied in reverse such that the last image is your
starting image.
</p>
<p>
You can just play the sequence on your screen or you can save it. In the latter case it will also
be played on your screen, but at the same time it will be saved, just like recording a GIF of a single
spiral.
</p>

<h3>Save sequence as picture per frame</h3>

Every created image is saved a JPG. If you set the sequence length to 100, then you get 100 JPGs!
<p>
It is recommended to save the pictures in a new album. This makes it easy to later delete the pictures
as you can simply delete the whole album. The album will be named "SpiralFun" followed by a date/timestamp.
</p>
<p>
Below you can see a sequence of length 3. It starts with the default configuration. The rotations
of the third circle are increased by 1 each time. This is the default mutation.

<img src="MS003.jpg" class="round" alt="" style="max-width: 30%; max-height: 230px; object-fit: contain;">

<h3>Save sequence as GIF</h3>

You can set the number of frames that should be played when you later view the GIF. The GIF
will be created in the "Spiral Fun" album.
<p>
Note that for large sequences the GIF can become very large, i.e. more than 100MB. The size
depends on the complexity of the spiral images.
</p>
<p>
Here is a sequence of 50 spirals, playing at a rate of 10 frames/sec.
